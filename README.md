> A door to know me and my work

Hello! And welcome to the repository of my personal website. I created it as<br>
a portfolio and for presentational purposes. It shows a couple of personal projects<br>
that I've been part of and it also gives easy access to anyone who would want <br>
to contact with me.

The project runs on the popular [React][react] framework [Next][next]. It uses [Vercel][vercel] for deployment, [Tailwindcss][tailwindcss] for styling and [Threejs][threejs] and [R3F][r3f] for 3D effects.
