#  ðŸš€ My personal website 

> A door to know me and my work

Hello! And welcome to the repository of my personal website. I created it as<br>
a portfolio and for presentational purposes. It shows a couple of personal projects<br>
that I've been part of and it also gives easy access to anyone who would want <br>
to contact with me. 


## ðŸ‘€ About me 

**RubÃ©n Chiquin** 

I'm a 20 years old student at the [Center of Image and Multimedia Technology (CITM)][CITM] at Barcelona.<br> I've been learning to code on my free time since I got introduced to the wonders of the <br>coding world, a couple years ago.

## </> Development setup

>For those who would like to know about the development set up an run it locally, here's how.

The project runs on the popular [React][React] framework [Next][Next]. It uses [Vercel][Vercel] for deployment, [Tailwindcss][Tailwindcss] for styling and [Threejs][Threejs] for 3d effects, among many other dependencies. 

Before anything else, be sure to have [nodejs and the yarn package manager installed][Nodejs]. If you're familiar with React,<br> then this should be familiar with you. After cloning the repo, on your console, run:

```sh
yarn install --frozen-lockfile
```

```sh
yarn dev
```


## The end!

Feel free to get in touch with me!
